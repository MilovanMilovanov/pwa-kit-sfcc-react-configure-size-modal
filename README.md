# pwa-kit-sfcc-react-configure-size-modal

My task was to create a Sizeconfigure modal, for finding best fit of a particular product, based on the customers parameters, like: height and weight, and feature to switch between units from kiligromas to pounds, and feet, inches to centimeters. 

There is no implemented logic to find the best size based of the choosed weight and height, since we moved to working with SFRA in SFCC, but instead we were told to find the first available size for the particular product, and display it as a 'best fit' before adding the product to the cart.
